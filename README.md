# WorldGraphIQ

A unified project exploring global population trends through comparative analysis, temporal forecasting, and socio-economic breakdowns.

## Completed Notebooks

### 1. `PopScope.ipynb`
- Analyzes country-level population growth
- Visualizes expansion trends over time
- Highlights high-growth zones using temporal segmentation and bar plots

### 2. `PeopleCount.ipynb`
- Compares regional and continental population sizes
- Ranks growth intensity across borders
- Links income groups to demographic density

### 3. `WorldPop_Insights.ipynb`
- Chronicles long-term population trajectories (1960–2024)
- Applies smoothing, time-series plots, and forecasting methods
- Reveals global momentum shifts
  
### 4. `DemographyIQ.ipynb`
- Focuses on gender and age distribution across selected countries
- Includes population pyramids, stacked bars, and heatmaps
- Integrates predictive modeling to explore demographic futures and inequality indicators
