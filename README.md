# WorldGraphIQ

A unified project exploring global population trends through comparative analysis, temporal forecasting, and socio-economic breakdowns.

## Completed Notebooks

### 1. PopScope.ipynb  
Analyzes country-level population growth and visualizes expansion trends over time.  
Highlights high-growth zones using temporal segmentation and bar plots.

### 2. PeopleCount.ipynb  
Compares regional and continental population sizes.  
Ranks growth intensity across borders and links income groups to demographic density.

### 3. WorldPop_Insights.ipynb  
Chronicles long-term population trajectories from 1960 to 2024.  
Applies smoothing, time-series plots, and forecasting methods to reveal global momentum shifts.
